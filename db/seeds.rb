# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Restaurant.destroy_all

# kfc = Restaurant.create(name: 'KFC' )
# kfc.reviews.create(rating:1, thoughts:'bad')
# kfc.reviews.create(rating:2, thoughts:'so so ')
# kfc.reviews.create(rating:3, thoughts:'too fried')
# kfc.reviews.create(rating:4, thoughts:'bad')
# kfc.reviews.create(rating:5, thoughts:'great')
# kfc.reviews.create(rating:3, thoughts:'bad')
